Purpose & Inspiration  
A major problem facing our society today is the need to care for our aging population.  People are living longer than ever before, meaning health conditions that previously only affected a small portion of the population are becoming increasingly common.  Tens of thousands of these individuals die as a direct result of falling.  In fact, falling is the leading cause of fatal injury among older adults.  For every 

Passion & Solution
When an older adult falls, the brunt of the injury is caused by continuing to go about day-to-day activities without consulting with their doctor.  By putting strain on injured joints, the injury is made worse, and a once fixable problem could become permanent.  It’s estimated that less than half of the falls suffered by elderly people are reported.  Out of all of the statistics we read, our group found this fact to be the most concerning.  Although elderly people may feel as though they’re avoiding embarrassment by not reporting a fall, they could be endangering themselves by not telling anyone.  With this in mind, we wanted to create a program that would automatically send a notification to a close relative, nurse, or doctor, if a fall was detected.

Strruggles & Outcomes

 The endproduct of these struggles led us to navigate and understand Microsoft's cloud Platform Azure in the time given, working extensively with sensor hardware, and explored multiple endpoint calls to azure and twilio from a java file. We are proud that we have over 200 lines of working code along with Processing. 
  
Future Implementations
With the new Kinect v3 coming out, we can implement Omi Cloud to work specifically with Azure for a smoothter process and transition through platforms and further utilize location services to give the most accurate emergency services along with a reply option upon replying “HELP” or “OKAY”, is either pointed to emergency phone number for further assistance or nothing.
